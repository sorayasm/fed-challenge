# FED Challenge

Using the following API (https://dummyapi.io/), develop a React or React Native (no
Expo) application that lets the user input any tags in a search bar and then shows all
posts containing that specific tag.

To use this API, you must first register and generate an 'app-id', which must be passed
to all requests as a header.

**Example**

If the user searches for the 'summer' tag, the app must show all posts tagged as
'summer'.


**Requirements**

- Must be built with React (or React Native)
- All styles are up to you. Show us your creativity!
- The app must be documented with README files
- All used libraries are optional and you may choose any that suits your project.

**Extra Points**

The following are NOT required, but may give you an advantage, so they are highly
encouraged:
- Use of React Hooks
- Any loading method (Suspense, loading state through Hooks, etc.)
- Animations
- Use of a state framework (Redux, MobX, etc.)
- Typescript
- App hosted on any site (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

**yarn start**

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
